              ***** Usage *****
              =================

The program can be used as a special musical instrument
or a voicing for Ukrainian text. It is not
phonetically exact and proper, but it gives
an inspiration to listen to the Ukrainian sounds more attentively.
It can be used by writers (especially poets) to compose melodic
texts. It can be used simply for the experiments. There is an
opinion that Ukrainian is a very melodic language, so you can
even not knowing it get some impression and get acquainted with
this beautiful language. There are a lot of songs in it and the
program is intended to open some part of beauty of the language itself.

The phonetic and writing system material are from the source:

[Solomija Buk, Ján Mačutek, Andrij Rovenchak. Some properties of
the Ukrainian writing system. Electronic resource](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/0802/0802.4198.pdf)

Since the version 0.9.0.0 switched to the ukrainian-phonetics-basic package.

Please, update all the dependent packages related to the mmsyn6ukr to use the new approach.
